### Creating a proxy

This example shows how to create a new proxy and how to the options are passed.

```js
const McProxy = require("minecraft-proxy");

let localServerOptions = {
	port: "25578",
	version: "1.12.1",
	"online-mode": false,
	motd: "nodejs minecraft proxy",
};

let serverList = [
	{
		name: "hub",
		settings: {
			host: "localhost",
			port: 25565,
			isDefault: true,
			isFallback: true,
		},
	},
	{
		name: "minigames",
		settings: {
			host: "localhost",
			port: 25566,
		},
	},
];

// if you leave proxyOptions empty yo may as well not pass it in the arguments, I wrote it anyway to point out that it exist
let proxyOptions = {};

/*
  Use the "/server <serverName>" command in chat to move between servers.
  <serverName> is the name that you chose for the server inside the serverList
  This command is implemented by /src/Plugins/ChatCommands.js and it can be disabled by setting enablePlugin: false inside proxyOptions
*/
let proxy = McProxy.createProxy(localServerOptions, serverList, proxyOptions);

proxy.on("error", console.error);

proxy.on("listening", () => {
	console.info("Listening!");
});
```

### Moving players from a server to another

In this example every player will be moved from the `hub` server (default) to the `minigames` server 30 seconds after having logged in.

```js
proxy.on("login", (player) => {
	setTimeout(() => {
		proxy.setRemoteServer(player.id, "minigames");
	}, 30 * 1000);
});
```
